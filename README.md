# Event Management System

This Event Management System allows users to organize and manage events efficiently. There are two types of users: Admin and Regular Users. Admins have additional privileges to manage events and users, while Regular Users can only post events.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users must log in to access certain features, such as posting events.
- **Admin Privileges**: Admins can delete, edit, and view all events and users. They have full control over the system.
- **Regular User Functionality**: Regular Users can post events but have limited access to other functionalities.
- **Session Management**: The system uses sessions to manage user authentication and maintain user states.

## Installation

To use this system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-management-system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd event-management-system
    ```

3. Import the SQL file `database.sql` into your MySQL database to set up the required database schema and sample data.

4. Configure the database connection in the `config.php` file by providing your MySQL database credentials:

    ```php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "your_username";
    $password = "your_password";
    $dbname = "your_database_name";
    ```

5. Ensure you have a web server (e.g., Apache) and PHP installed on your machine to run the system. You can use tools like XAMPP or WAMP for local development.

6. Start your web server and navigate to the project directory in your web browser to access the system.

## Usage

- From the admin dashboard, admins can manage events and users, including deleting, editing, and viewing events and users.
- Regular Users can log in to post events. They have limited access to other functionalities.
- All users can view events on the homepage and click on individual events to view their details.
